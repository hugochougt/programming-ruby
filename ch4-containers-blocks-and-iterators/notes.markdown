Mastery of arrays and hashes is key to being an effective Ruby programmer.

Arrays are indexed using the [] operator. As with most Ruby operators, this is actually a method (an instance method of class Array) and hence can be overridden in subclasses.

[]= IS a operator, which lets you set elements in the array.

You can treat arrays as stacks, sets, queues, dequeues, and FIFO queues by using other useful methods of Array class, such as push and pop, unshift and shift, first and last, etc.

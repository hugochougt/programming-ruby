Ruby name conventions

The first characters of a name indicate how the name is used.

Local variables, method parameters, and method name should all start with a lowercase letter or an underscore.

Global variables are prefixed with a dollar sign ($), and instance variables begin with an "at" sign (@).

Class variables start with two "at" signs (@@).

Class names, module names, and constants must start with an uppercase letter.

Following this initial character, a name can be any combination of letters, digits, and underscores (with the proviso that the character following an @ sign may not be a digit). However, by convention, multiword instance variables are written with underscores between the words, and multiword class names are written in MixedCase (with each word capitalized). Method names may end with the characters ?, ! and =.
